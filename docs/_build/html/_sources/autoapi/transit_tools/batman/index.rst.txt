.. function:: full_batlc(period, rp, a, noise='obs', inlc=None, t0=None, sectors='all', cadence='2min', **kwargs)

   Function to retrive a full simulated BATMAN light curve complete with
   injected noise.

   !!Allow custom noise model!!
   !!Update name processing once name processing wrapper function written!!
   !!Utilize actual stellar params somehow?!!
   !!Search for known planets in the real system and pass those on as well!!
   !!Write docstrings!!
   !!Pass which TIC ID was used!!
   !!Allow for generation of gaussian noise!!
   !!Allow custom lc for inlc!!
   !!Raise error for noise='obs' and inlc=None!!

   :param period: Orbital period to be simulated. Should be in days.
   :type period: float
   :param rp: Radius of planet in units of host star radii. Essentially Rp/Rs.
   :type rp: float
   :param a: Semi-major axis of the orbit in units of host star radii.
   :type a: float
   :param noise: Noise to be included in simulation. Current options are 'obs' for
                 injection into pre-existing light curve or None for a simulated light
                 curve without noise. Gaussian noise is expected in the future.
   :type noise: str or None
   :param inlc: TIC ID of light curve for simulations to be injected into. Can be set to
                None for a light curve to be randomly chosen from a pre-selected list in
                transit_tools/files/lc_list.csv if noise='obs'.
   :type inlc: None or int
   :param t0: Mid-transit time of the first transit. If None, t0 will be randomly
              generated to be somewhere within 1 period of the start of the
              observation. Must be in the same units as period.
   :type t0: float or None
   :param sectors: Sectors to be considered for retrieving light curves specified by inlc.
                   If 'all', all available light curves for selected inlc will be
                   retrieved, otherwise only those contained in the user-provided array will
                   be retrieved.
   :type sectors: str or array
   :param cadence: Cadence of TESS light curve to retrieve. Options are '2min', 'ffi_ml', or
                   'eleanor'. This method is passed to transit_tools.fetch_lc.gather_lc and
                   follows those hierarchy rules if a light curve at the given cadence
                   cannot be found.
   :type cadence: str
   :param kwargs: Additional arguments to be passed to transit_tools.batman_transit.


.. function:: batman_transit(period, rp, a, u=[0.4804, 0.1867], t0=0.0, inc=90.0, ecc=0.0, w=90.0, limb_dark='quadratic', cadence=0.01, length=None, time=None, **kwargs)

   Function to generate a simulated 'LightCurve' object using the BATMAN
   package developed by Laura Kreidberg. Please see BATMAN documentation for a
   more in-depth description of each parameter.

   !!Fix length argument. Make it remove parts of light curve from boths sides
     of transit!!
   !!Integrate supersample_factor and exp_time arguments better since they're
     likely going to be common for TESS. Maybe automatically do it for user!!

   :param period: Orbital period in days of the simulated planet.
   :type period: float
   :param rp: Radius of planet in units of stellar radii.
   :type rp: float
   :param a: Semi-major axis of planet orbit in units of stellar radii.
   :type a: float
   :param u: Limb darkening coefficients. Defaults to a G2V star in the Kepler
             bandpass.
   :type u: array
   :param t0: Mid-transit time of the first transit.
   :type t0: float
   :param inc: Orbital inclination in degrees.
   :type inc: float
   :param ecc: Eccentricity of planet orbit. May cause simulation to run slowly if set
               to a nonzero eccentricity and noise is added using a separate function.
   :type ecc: float
   :param w: Longitude of periastron in degrees.
   :type w: float
   :param limb_dark: Limb darkening model.
   :type limb_dark: str
   :param cadence: Cadence of data points in minutes.
   :type cadence: float
   :param length: Length of output light curve in days. If set to None, defaults to one
                  orbital period in length centered on the first transit.
   :type length: float or None
   :param time: Array of time points during which the light curve will be simulated.
   :type time: array
   :param kwargs: Additional arguments to be passed to batman.TransitModel. For TESS
                  light curves, it is recommended to specify the supersample_factor and
                  exp_time arguments for best results.

   :returns: **lc** -- The light curve of the simulated planet transit for one full orbital
             period. Light curve will have attribute 'params' that is an object
             containing all of the input simulated parameters.
   :rtype: 'LightCurve' object
