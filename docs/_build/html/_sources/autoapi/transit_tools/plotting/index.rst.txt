.. function:: tls_vetsheet(lc, results=0, show=True, save=False, savename='vetsheet.png')

   Function to plot a vetting sheet after running the
   transit_tools.signal_search function. Output is formatted to fit onto a
   standard 8"x11" sheet of paper.

   !!Add functionality to plot without having to run search?!!
   !!Add vertical lines for expected transit times on unprocessed LC!!
   !!Change x-axis phase values for odd-even plot!!
   !!Make processed and unprocessed x-axes line up, especially when LC is
     masked. Maybe include grayed-out parts that were masked!!

   :param lc: Input transit_tools 'lightcurve' object that has had a signal search
              performed on it.
   :type lc: 'lightcurve' object
   :param results: Index of results attribute array of provided 'lightcurve' object.
                   Indicates which set of results to plot if signal_search produced more
                   than one set of output results. Can be set to -1 to display the most
                   recent signal run that did not meet the significance threshold.
   :type results: int
   :param show: Flag to determine whether plots will be displayed or not. Must be set to
                False or 'both' for output matplotlib object to be expected.
   :type show: bool or str
   :param save: Flag to determine whether the plots will be saved as a PNG.
   :type save: bool
   :param savename: File name for plots to be saved as if save is set to True.
   :type savename: str or None

   :returns: **plots** -- Output matplotlib plot object. Optional if show is set to False or
             'both'.
   :rtype: matplotlib object
